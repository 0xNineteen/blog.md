# ZK 101: Schnorr's Protocol 

If you use crypto and own the latest shitcoins, then you own a wallet consisting of a public and private key. 

**Lets say you want to prove to your friends that you own your public key (and all the shitcoins belonging to it).** One way to do so would be to show your friend your private key, but that would be bad because they could sign any transaction and steal all your shitcoins.

Ideally, you want to prove to your friend you own a private key corresponding to your public key without revealing any information about your private key. 

**In this post we'll cover how to prove you know your private key without revealing it using a zero-knowledge (ZK) proof and implement it in python.**

## Schnorrâ€™s Identification Protocol 

We first define some things: 
- $x$: is our private key 
- $g$: is some value/message (can be anything)
- $h$: is g encrypted with our private key ($h = g^x$)
- $q$: is our modulus value (its the same as $n$ in the last RSA post)

**figure 1** from [here](https://www.zkdocs.com/docs/zkdocs/zero-knowledge-protocols/schnorr/)

Breaking this figure down further, the public inputs are q (our mod value), g (some message), and h (the message encrypted). 

In python, we can set it up as so

```python 
import rsa
import numpy as np 

## generate the public and private keys 
(pub, priv) = rsa.newkeys(128)
e = pub.e # public key 
q = pub.n # mod value 
x = priv.d # private key -- we want to prove we know x

g = 19 # can be anything 
h = pow(g, x, q) # encrypted message
```

The heart of the ZK proof utilizes the math theorem,
$$
x^a * x^b = x^{a + b}
$$

we'll see how its used later.

*Footnote:* Related to this is *homomorphic hiding* which is a way to operate on encrypted data.

We start by generating a random value $r$ to encrypt our message $g$ with, deriving $u$. We then send $u$ to our friend. 

```python 
r = np.random.randint(0, 1e3)
u = pow(g, r, q)
```

The friend computes a new random value $c$ and sends it back to us. 

```python 
c = np.random.randint(0, 1e3)
```

We then compute $z = r + x * c$ and send $z$ to our friend. 

```python 
z = r + x * c 
```

They can then check if the following equality holds:

$$
\begin{equation}
g^z \stackrel{?}{=} u * h^c 
\end{equation}
$$

```python 
left_side = pow(g, z, q)
right_side = (u * pow(h, c, q)) % q

assert left_side == right_side # True 
```

To know why this works we can expand the variables and simplify 
$$
g^z \stackrel{?}{=} u * h^c \\ 
g^{r + x * c} \stackrel{?}{=} g^r * (g^x)^c \\
g^{r + x * c} \equiv g^{r + x * c} 
$$

Notice how in (1) our friend has no information on our private key, $x$ They only know $z$, $u$, $h$, and $c$. Furthermore, we would only be able to give them a $z$ which makes (1) true if we know the private key $x$! 

pretty cool stuff

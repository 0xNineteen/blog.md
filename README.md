- [Consensus 101: The Dolev-Strong Protocol](https://github.com/0xNineteen/blog.md/blob/master/blockchain-01/dolev.ipynb): Python implementation of the Dolev-Strong Protocol which works even with 99% evil nodes.  

- [Fuzzy Testing and Large-Scale Simulations For Improved Protocols](https://github.com/0xNineteen/blog.md/blob/master/protocol-sims/gpt3.md): How fuzzy testing and large-scale simulations can help improve blockchain protocol security by discovering bugs and anomalies that simple unit tests cannot.

- [Drift V2: DAMM JIT](https://twitter.com/0xNineteen/status/1571926865681711104?s=20&t=NoH3aXLAh7DRgxh46T8j-w): new feature that allows the AMM to take a slice of maker orders so its long/short imbalance is always guaranteed to improve; the protocol essentially frontruns maker orders (PEV example irl). 

- [PEV: Protocol Extractable Value](https://github.com/0xNineteen/blog.md/blob/master/mev-v2/index.md): How protocols are in the position to extract value (which is currently being extracted by validators) that can generate more revenue for the protocol's dao, treasury, or users. 

- [ZK 101: Schnorr's Protocol](https://github.com/0xNineteen/blog.md/blob/master/schnorr-zk/index.md): One of the simplest ZK proofs in the book: proving you own a private key without revealing it (python code included).

- [RSA Public-Key Cryptography](https://github.com/0xNineteen/blog.md/blob/master/rsa-encryption/index.md): Proof that RSA public-key cryptography encryption and decryption works. 

- [The Evolution of Margin in Crypto: The Birth of Perps](https://github.com/0xNineteen/blog.md/blob/master/crypto-margin-perps/index.md): Brief overview about understanding the pros of perps and how they work in a PvP and PvE setting.  

- [Rust Macros and Arbitrage Bots on Solana](https://github.com/0xNineteen/blog.md/blob/master/rust-macros-arbitrage/index.md): Practical example of how to use rust macros. The example includes writing an arbitrage bot for Solana.

- [A New Perspective on BTC's POW](https://github.com/0xNineteen/blog.md/blob/master/btc-consensus/index.md): Short post on how BTC's POW is a decentralized clock which doesn't require any coordination/agreement on time.
